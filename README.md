# eCOBIDAS

**A checklist for methods and results reporting for neuroimaging studies**

Try the app for fMRI [HERE](https://ohbm.github.io/eCOBIDAS/#/)!

This checklist is still work in progress. The current prototype has been built
using the 88 metadata items list used by the
[Neurovault website](https://neurovault.org/) when uploading your neuroimaging
results.

We are currently working to create a more complete checklist as described in the
OHBM COBIDAS reports for MRI, fMRI, EEG and MEG (see [below](#Background) for
more information).

But there is already a prototype version for PET
[there](https://remi-gau.github.io/cobidas-PET/#/)!

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
corresponding to your fMRI analysis. This is meant to make sure that you have
not forgotten any of the essential information in the methods and results parts
of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing
machine readable json files that captures information about your method/results
section: our next step is to use this to automate the part of the methods
writing and to submit the information alongside data submission to Neurovault
and other data archives.

## Why this project?

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the
replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results
and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is
built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our
research.

[motivations behind this project](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/why_this_project.md).

## Background

This checklist is a project to make a user friendly checklist out the best
practices [report](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/COBIDASreport) of the
Committee on Best Practices in Data Analysis and Sharing
([COBIDAS](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/cobidas/)) of the
[Organization for Human Brain Mapping](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org).

Currently the sections and items in the checklist correspond to the list of
metadata used by [neurovault website](https://neurovault.org/) when uploading
your neuroimaging results.

This is very much of a work in progress but the next step is to expand the list
to cover all the items of the COBIDAS report for fMRI as well as for the recent
[extension to EEG and MEG](https://osf.io/a8dhx/).

## Want to help?

We are currently working on trying to expand the number of items used in the
checklist. All of this work is done in google spreadsheets.

The MRI spreadsheet is accessible
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCXP0MTK3DjY09ZFd7FXgv0Ngx16_YJwVBiXOeQbTho/edit?usp=sharing)

The M/EEG spreadsheet is accessible
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OhkmbtgIWdFxSVjpu6A8PWoAuqev0jY-98GFQlwBCy0/edit?usp=sharing)

For more information on the content and organization of these spreadsheets, see
the dedicated
[document](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/spreadsheet_content.md)

There is also an [OSF project](https://osf.io/anvqy/) to centralize all the
information and repos.

We have a
[list](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/COBIDAS_chckls/blob/master/goals.md) of
short, middle, long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in
touch. Many of them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills
(except maybe a certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be
super organized) :wink:.
