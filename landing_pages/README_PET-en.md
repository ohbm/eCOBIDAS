# eCOBIDAS for PET

**A checklist for methods and results reporting for PET studies**

<!-- We are currently working to create a more complete checklist as described in the OHBM COBIDAS reports for MRI, fMRI, EEG and MEG (see [below](#Background) for more information).  -->

## How to use it

You can navigate each section on the left and then answer the questions
corresponding to your PET analysis. This is meant to make sure that you have
not forgotten any of the essential information during data collection or later
in the methods and results parts of your article.

At the end, you can click on `Export` (bottom left) to get a zip file containing
machine readable json files that captures information about your method/results
section: our next step is to use this to automate the part of the methods
writing and to submit the information alongside data submission to a journal and
other data archives.

## Why this project?

Poor methods and results description hinders the reproducibility and the
replicability of research. It also makes it hard to compare new and old results
and generally increases inefficiency in the research process. This project is
built on the hope that improving methods and results reporting could improve our
research.

## Want to help?

We have a [list](https://remi-gau.github.io/eCobidas/#goals) of short, middle,
long term goals: if you are interested by any of those get in touch. Many of
them do not necessarily require super-advanced technical skills (except maybe a
certain love for working with spreadsheet and wanting them to be super
organized) :wink:.

We are currently working on trying to expand the number of items used in the
checklist. All of this work is done in google spreadsheets.

For more information on the content and organization of these spreadsheets see
[HERE](https://remi-gau.github.io/eCobidas/40-spreadsheets/).
